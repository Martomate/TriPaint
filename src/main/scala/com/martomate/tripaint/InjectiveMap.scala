/**
  * An `InjectiveMap` is like a bidirectional Map with both unique keys and unique values.
  * This makes the mapping injective.<br />
  * It can be seen as a collection of pairs `(l, r)` where both l and r can be used to find, update and remove the mappings.<br />
  * If you call e.g. `removeLeft(l)`, then the pair `(l, r)` will be removed (which means that r is removed too, and since
  * it doesn't exist in any other pair it is no longer present in this map).<br />
  *
  * @tparam L   The Left type
  * @tparam R   The Right type
